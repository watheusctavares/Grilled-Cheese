# Camera Configuration File
# all angles in degrees
# all linear measurements in game units
# all indices start from zero except camera index, 
#   which corresponds to the key you press to activate
#   the desired camera (thus, '1' is the first camera)

# Acceptable controller types are "SmoothSims1", "sims2lot", "Neighborhood", "Mouse", and "Maya" (without quotes)
# "sims2lot" is the in game camera use when on a lot.
# "neighborhood" is the camera use when in the neighborhood view.

# usage: for each camera...
# camera      <identifierString> <controllerType>

# If controllerType is SmoothSims1, the following controller parameters can be defined:
# zoom        <defaultZoomLevelIndex> (horizontal distances) [(FOVs) (near clip distances) (far clip distances) (min camera pitch angles) (max camera pitch angles)]
# fov         (field of views)
# clip        (near clip distances) (far clip distances)
# orientation <defaultOrientationIndex> (yaw angles)
# smoothing   <zoom duration> <spin duration>
#   where the smaller the duration (must be an integer >= 1) the more abrupt the transition
# slope       <slope value>
#   where slope value is the (positive) ratio dy/dx (change in y per unit change in x)
#   this value is only used if no min/max camera pitch angles are specified for the zoom command
# wheel       <wheel scaling>
#   where wheel scaling is a multiplier that determines how quickly the zoom level adjusts in response to the mouse wheel

# If controllerType is Mouse or Maya, there are no user-settable parameters. The camera definition then 
# consists solely of the line which contains the identifier string and controller type.
