# File to specify levels at which various LODs should be used.
#
# Syntax: LOD <lod number, 1-30> <screen size of object>
#
# The screen size is the larger of the horizontal and vertical sizes of the object on the screen.
# If the object does not have the specific LOD listed here, the next higher LOD is used.
# No interpolation is done between the LODs listed in this file. This allows using only as 
# many LODs as needed e.g. on a low-end machine an "aggressive" use of LODs might
# list all 30 levels possible; on a high-end machine only 1 or 2 levels may be necessary.
# A future enhancement is to support such machine-specific specification of LODs e.g.
# with -aggressive, -moderate switches on the LOD command.
