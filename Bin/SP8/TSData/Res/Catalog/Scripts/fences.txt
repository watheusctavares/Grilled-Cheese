# fences.txt -- fence products
#
# NOTE: A fence is a type of partition, and therefore is referred to
#       as a partition in the comments for those settings that are generic
#       to all partitions.
#
# NOTE: The IDs here are in the same number space as the IDs in
#       walls.txt and fenceArches.txt.  Make sure there are no duplicates within or
#       between these files.
#
# NOTE: IDs must be less than 255.
#
# Syntax Summary

#   that contains the build/decorating tip text that will be
#   appended to the catalog description of the following entries.

#   the game uses internally to refer to this fence.
#

#   the name of the 3D resource representing the horizontal part of
#   the fence stretching between posts one game unit apart.
#
# diagRailModel "XXXXX"
#   the name of the 3D resource representing the horizontal part of
#   the fence stretching between posts sqrt(2) game units apart.
#
# postModel "XXXXX"
#   the name of the 3D resource representing the vertical part of
#   the fence anchoring one or more rails.
