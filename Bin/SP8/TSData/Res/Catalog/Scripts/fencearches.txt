# fencearches.txt -- fence arch products
#
# NOTE: A fence arch is a type of partition, and therefore is referred to
#       as a partition in the comments for those settings that are generic
#       to all partitions.
#
# NOTE: The IDs here are in the same number space as the IDs in
#       fences.txt and walls.txt.  Make sure there are no duplicates 
#       within or between these files.
#
# NOTE: IDs must be less than 255.
