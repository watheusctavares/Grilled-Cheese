# walls.txt -- walls with engine-generated geometry
#
# NOTE: A wall is a type of partition, and therefore is referred to
#       as a partition in the comments for those settings that are generic
#       to all partitions.
#
# NOTE: The IDs here are in the same number space as the IDs in
#       fences.txt and fenceArches.txt.  Make sure there are no duplicates 
#       within or between these files.
#
# NOTE: IDs must be less than 255.
#
# Syntax Summary
#
# catalogTextResource XXXX X
#   the name of the IFF file and the index of the stringset
#   within that file holding the strings to use for catalog 
#   descriptions and related metadata.
#
# wall X  (required)
#   used to start a new block for a wall product.  Specifies the ID
#   the game uses internally to refer to this wall type.
#
# defaultPattern "XXXXX"  (required)
#   the name of the wallPattern applied to this wall when it is first created.
#
# wallThickness [standard|none] (default: standard)
#   the thickness category of this wall.
#
# mayChangeSurface [true|false] (default: true)
#   whether or not the user is allowed to change the surface treatment after creation.
#
# mayAttachObjects [true|false] (default: true)
#   whether or not it is allowed to attach objects to this partition style.
#
# mayCutAway [true|false] (default: true)
#   whether or not wall cutaway mode affects this partition style.
#
# requiresFlatBottom [true|false] (default: true)
#   whether or not this partition has a level bottom (that must remain level).
#
# requiresFlatTop [true|false] (default: true)
#   whether or not this partition has a level top (that must remain level).
#
# submersible [true|false] (default: true)
#   whether or not this partition can be placed in water.
#
# mayPlaceDiagonally [true|false] (default: true)
#   whether or not this partition supports placement diagonally across a tile
#   (as opposed to along a tile edge).
#
# verticalSpan [floorToFloor|floorToRoof|fixedHeight|floorToFloorBasedCeiling] (default: floorToFloor)
#   how to determine the top of the partition when rendering it.
#   ("floorToFloorBasedCeiling" differs from "floorToFloor" by having its top
#    level with the bottom of the floor thickness geometry on the level above,
#    rather than level with the floor above)
#
# blocksPlacement [true|false] (default: true)
#   whether or not this partition affects placement of objects and routing on
#   the same level as the partition.
#
# bearsLoad [true|false] (default: true)
#   whether or not this partition supports objects or build mode items on the
#   level above it.
#
# blocksLight [true|false] (default: true)
#   whether or not this partition prevents light (and sound) from passing through it.
#
# hasLightMap [true| false] (default: true)
#   whether or not this partition should have a light map applied to and calculated for it.
#
# notRendered
#   the graphics system will not render this partition.
#
# deleteTool [partition|roof|levelRoom|modularStairs] (default allows any tool to delete)
#   says which user tool is allowed to delete this type of partition 
#   (only one tool allowed per product)
#
# requiresSupportUnderneath [true|false]
#   whether or not this partition needs to be placed on top of a structure, floor, or terrain.
#
# thumbnailResource x y
#   group and instance id (in hex) of the thumbnail resource representing this
#   product in the catalog.
#
# catalogTextIndex X
#   this informs the catalog at what index in the catalogTextStringSet
#   to find the descriptive text for the catalog item
#
# buildTipIndices x ...
#   the indices of the strings in the build tip stringset
#   that contain the build/decorating tip text that will be
#   appended to the catalog description of each clone of the following entries. 
#
# notInCatalog
#   used instead of "catalogTextIndex X" to designate this item should 
#   not appear in the catalog UI
#
# invisibleLightBlocking
#   make a wall invisible but light blocking
