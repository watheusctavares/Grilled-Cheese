#   the GUID (in 32-bit hexadecimal) of the selector for the object representing 
#   a column supporting a deck at terrain level from below.
#
# supportObjectUpperLevel 0xHHHHHHHH
#   the GUID (in 32-bit hexadecimal) of the selector for the object representing 
#   a column supporting a deck above terrain level from below.
#
# supportLayout [-floodfill] [-edgefill] [-corners] [-spacing n]
#   the layout pattern for supports.  
#   "floodfill" means the interior of the deck/foundation will be filled with supports
#   "edgefill" means the edges of the deck/foundation will be lined with supports
#   "corners" means each corner of the deck/foundation will have a support
#   "spacing" specifies how many tiles between supports (default is 1).
#   0 = no supports, 1 = every tile, 2 = every other tile, etc.
